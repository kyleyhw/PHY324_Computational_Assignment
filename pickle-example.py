the above few lines makes an array called data_from_file which contains
a noisy sine wave as long as you downloaded the file "noisy_sine_wave" 
and put it in the same directory as this python file

pickle is a Python package which nicely saves data to files. it can be
a little tricky when you save lots of data, but this file only has one
object (an array) saved so it is pretty easy
